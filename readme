debut ---

    Debut is a spreadsheet made in C, why? j'me suis dit pourquoi pas. It got two modes
    which are:

    Mode 1: This mode only parses and solves the table given, it means you gotta have a file
    already made to be solved by Debut, the condition is that the table must look like this:

    | ... | ...
    | ... | ... | ...

    It means every '|' makes a new cell, this mode will write the result in the standard output
    unless the -o <filename> was used, in that case the output will be written on <filename>.

    This mode is set by the argument -p <filename> where filename is the table you want to parse.

    Mode 2: This mode uses a UI, it means it will make a whole spreadsheet in your terminal where
    you can type all the stuff you want and see the results at the moment you type them, this mode
    is enalbled by the argument -u <filename> where <filename> stands for the filename you want to
    load, if no filename is specified then it starts a new spreadsheet; it will also save the sheet
    into a file if it is requested by -o <filename>.
